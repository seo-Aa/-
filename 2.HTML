  <h2>CSS<h2>
    <P>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language
    that describes how markup languages are actually displayed[1],
    and is used mainly in HTML and XHTML, and is also available in XML.
    <storong>It is the standard of <w>W3C</w> and has a high degree of freedom in defining layouts and styles.</storong>
    <u>The default file name[2] is style.css.</u>
    if the markup language (ex:HTML) is in charge of the body of the website,
    the CSS can be said to be in charge of decorating like clothes and accessories.
    In other words, you can decorate it like a completely different website
    by just changing the CSS file while leaving the HTML structure intact.
    In the case of CSS3, which is currently being developed,
    features that can replace images produced by graphic editing programs such
    as shadow effects, gradations, and variations have been added.
    In addition, various animation functions have been added to replace Adobe Flash to some extent.</p>

 <h2>Jastript<h2>
  JavaScript is an object-based script programming language.
  This language is mainly used within web browsers and has the ability to access embedded objects in other applications.
  it is also used for server programming, such as runtime environments such as Node.
  js. JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications
  Corporation under the name Mocha, later LiveScript, and eventually became JavaScript.
  Although JavaScript's syntax is similar to that of Java in Microsystems,
   both languages are actually based on the basic syntax of the C language,
  and JavaScript has a weak direct connection. Other than its name and syntax,
  it has more similarities to self or scheme than Java.
  JavaScript is recognized as the best implementation of ECMAScript's standard specifications,
  and up to ECMAScript 5 (ES5) was supported by most browsers, but after ECMAScript 6, it is compiled as a translator for browser compatibility.[4]
